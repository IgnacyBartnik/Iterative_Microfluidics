    "Welcome to this short explantion of the various features of the 4pump_control.py software\n",
    "This code was written to control a 4 input microfluidic mixer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind the project was to make a 4 input microfluidic chip, that would be able to take 2 chemicals, and dilute each one independently, and search for various interesting chemical features at different concentrations and stoichometries of chemicals. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code is based on the 2pump_control.py file. If you wish to understand the code itself, it would be best to start with understanding the 2pump_control.py code, and then moving on to the 4pump_control.py code. If you wish to simply understand the features of the code, this explainer should be sufficient, without having to go through the 2pump_control explainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the code was to control a 4 input microfluidic mixer chip, that could mix 2 substances in various proportions and various dilutions of each susbtance. Due to time limitation, only the dilution target was implemented, so the code, combined with the mixrofluidic chip, could dilute 2 subtances individually, and therefore vary the ratio of one substances to another substance at the measurement point. This was done by varying the flow rate ratio (FRR) of the dilution agent and substances. However, the code is not written to vary the FRR of the two already diluted streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no large obstacles in the development of that code. Currently, the program is configured to have a 1:1 FRR of the two diluted subtance streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to understand the program more deeply, let us start at the beginning. Let us load the appropriate file. Note that this file relies the connect.py file, so both need to be present in the same directory for the program to function as intended."

Therefore, for each pair of pumps, the sum of their pump powers must be equal to 1. In this code, the pairs of pumps and pump 1 & 2 and pump 3 & 4. Together, these pairs pump out the overall flow defined in the class initialization, so each pair's overall output is half on the overall flow defined.\n",
